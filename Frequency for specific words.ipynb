      "   In order to address infrastructure gaps, large projects are under execution and many more are in the pipeline thanks to a wide variety of financing sources. The construction of a mega-port in the Caribbean coast awarded to the Dutch based, APM Terminals,6 advances as programmed and is expected to be operational in 2018. A new highwayŠin the north part of the Inter-American highway, key for trade and tourismŠis almost ready and will come into operation next month. Major projects to revamp the capital beltway are currently under execution with some sections projected to open this year. Other key routes, including connections to the new port, will begin major overhauling next year using already secured funding from China, multilaterals and a novel figure through bank trusts.7 Costa Rica™s environmental friendly policies are deeply entrenched in the population. Electricity generation is an example where 97 percent was produced from renewable sources during 2016 first quarter, following the same pattern of 2015. Most of them, 65 percent, came from hydroelectric power plants, while 16 percent from wind, 14 percent from geothermal and two percent from biomass. Solar energy represents a fraction but its participation would probably increase. The system delivers a high quality service and network coverage is very high compared to regional standards. In line with its ambitious environmental goals a wastewater treatment plant, financed through Japan™s cooperation agency, was inaugurated last year which would duplicate the percentage of treated water in the short-run and, as the sewerage network is developed, it would initially take the water treated percentage up to 27 percent of the population.The authorities are committed to further strengthening the policy mix to preserve macroeconomic and financial stability as these are key to maintain Costa Rica™s strong structural features such as high income per capita, social development and governance indicators, which are also supporting \n",
      "the process to become an OECD member.6 APM Terminals is an independent business unit within the Danish-based Maersk Group.7 There is one project using this financial model already approved by congress. Predefine future tolls would be securitized to finance the road construction. 4 6\n",

      " 2016, the stock of credit to households for house purchase continued the declining path initiated in 2011, while credit for consumption has been accelerating and showing positive growth rates since the second half of 2015. The implementation of the above-mentioned Programa Capitalizar should also support companies™ efforts to diversify their financing sources and, simultaneously, to strengthen their capitalization with the contribution of financial, fiscal and legal instruments.  The uncertainty underlying the global economic outlook, in conjunction with some geographic concentration of banks™ activity, represents an additional risk for the banking sector. In particular, the direct and indirect exposures of Portuguese banks to emerging market economies (i.e. loans to corporations with significant commercial and investment relations with those economies), as Angola, are significant and may lead, in the current juncture, to additional losses for Portuguese banks.Regarding Caixa Geral de Depositos, the state owned bank and the largest bank in Portugal, an agreement on its recapitalization was reached between the Government and the European institutions. The chosen approach is a market-based operation that allows for the bank to be adequately capitalized and able to fulfill its mission, while complying with EU rules.To sum up, despite some positive signals observed more recently (in terms, for instance, of the banks™ financing structure and of firms™ deleveraging), the adjustment of the banking sector is still ongoing and some significant challenges persist, notably regarding their profitability and the high stock of NPLs.VI Œ ConclusionThe Portuguese authorities are certain that their obligations towards the Fund will be timely met, as has been the case so far.Economic growth, social cohesion, sound public finances and financial stability are the goals to be met, whilst the unintended effects of the adjustment process, i.e. rising inequality and emigration, must, and will, be adequately tackled.Structural reforms will continue to be implemented, based on the lessons learned from previous efforts, with fine-tuning as needed, and with the launching of new initiatives in order to achieve a competitive and balanced economy. Time and stability are required in order for the reforms Œ implemented before, under and after the Economic and Financial Adjustment Program  to produce the desired effects.The Portuguese authorities look forward to the fifth PPM mission, which will constitute a good opportunity to closely work with the IMF, deepening our dialogue and promoting a closer mutual understanding. 6 REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN \n",
